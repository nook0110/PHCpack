 * DESCRIPTION :
 *   Tests the evaluation and differentiation for random real data.

 * ON ENTRY :
 *   dim      dimension, total number of variables;
 *   nbr      number of terms in the polynomial;
 *   nva      number of variables per monomial (for products and cyclic);
 *   pwr      highest power of each variable;
 *   deg      truncation degree of the series;
 *   verbose  if zero, then no output is written,
 *            otherwise, the higher the value, the more input. */

 * DESCRIPTION :
 *   Runs tests on a random polynomial in double precision.
 *   Returns 0 if all tests passed,

 *   deg      truncation degree of the series;
 *   vrblvl   is the verbose level, if 0 then no output,
 *            otherwise, the higher the value, the more output:
 *            if 1, then the sum of all errors is shown,
 *            if 2, then job counts and timings are listed,
 *            if 3 (or higher), then all values are written;
 *   tol      tolerance to decide pass or fail,
 *            fail if the sum of all errors is larger than tol. */
